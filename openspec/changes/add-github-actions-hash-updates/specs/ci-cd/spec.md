## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Automated Hash Updates for Renovate PRs

The system SHALL automatically update package hashes in Nix package definitions when Renovate creates version update PRs.

#### Scenario: GCS package hash update

- **WHEN** Renovate creates a PR updating GCS package version
- **THEN** the system automatically runs `nix-update --version=skip gcs`
- **AND** commits the updated hash to the PR branch
- **AND** verifies the package builds successfully on all platforms

#### Scenario: OpenCode TUI component hash update

- **WHEN** Renovate creates a PR updating OpenCode package version
- **THEN** the system automatically runs `nix-update --version=skip --subpackage tui opencode`
- **AND** commits the updated TUI hash to the PR branch
- **AND** verifies the TUI component builds successfully

#### Scenario: Multi-platform hash consistency

- **WHEN** hash updates are applied to a PR
- **THEN** the system ensures hashes are updated for all supported platforms (aarch64-darwin, x86_64-linux, x86_64-darwin, aarch64-linux)
- **AND** verifies builds pass on each platform

### Requirement: Build Verification

The system SHALL verify that updated packages build successfully before considering the hash update complete.

#### Scenario: Successful build verification

- **WHEN** hash updates are applied to package definitions
- **THEN** the system runs `nix build .#<package-name>` for each affected package
- **AND** the PR is marked as ready for review if all builds succeed

#### Scenario: Build failure handling

- **WHEN** a package fails to build after hash update
- **THEN** the system reports the build failure in the PR
- **AND** provides detailed error information
- **AND** does not mark the PR as ready for automatic merging

### Requirement: PR Management

The system SHALL properly manage the PR lifecycle during automated hash updates.

#### Scenario: Automated commit to PR branch

- **WHEN** hash updates are successfully applied
- **THEN** the system commits the changes to the existing PR branch
- **AND** preserves the original PR author and commit message structure
- **AND** adds appropriate commit message indicating hash updates

#### Scenario: PR comment notifications

- **WHEN** hash update process completes (success or failure)
- **THEN** the system posts a comment to the PR with status information
- **AND** includes relevant error details if the process failed

### Requirement: Error Handling and Reporting

The system SHALL provide comprehensive error handling and reporting for the hash update process.

#### Scenario: nix-update failure

- **WHEN** `nix-update --version=skip` fails for a package
- **THEN** the system captures the error output
- **AND** reports the specific failure reason in the PR
- **AND** continues processing other packages if multiple are affected

#### Scenario: Platform-specific failures

- **WHEN** hash updates succeed on some platforms but fail on others
- **THEN** the system reports which platforms succeeded and which failed
- **AND** provides platform-specific error details
- **AND** allows manual intervention for problematic platforms
